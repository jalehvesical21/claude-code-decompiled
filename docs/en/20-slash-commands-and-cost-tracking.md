# Slash Commands and Cost Tracking

## Opening: 80+ Commands Is a Lot

When I first opened the `commands.ts` registry file in Claude Code, I counted the imports. Then I counted again. There are over 80 static imports at the top of the file, and that is before you add feature-gated conditional imports, plugin commands, skill directory commands, MCP-provided commands, workflow commands, bundled skills, and dynamically discovered skills. The total command surface area in a fully loaded Claude Code session can easily exceed 100 entries.

That is a staggering number for a CLI tool. Most terminal applications I have worked with top out around 15-20 commands before users start losing track. Claude Code is in a different category entirely -- it is not just a CLI, it is a full development environment that happens to live in your terminal. The slash command system is the primary control surface for everything from session management (`/resume`, `/session`, `/rename`) to cost tracking (`/cost`, `/usage`) to developer workflow (`/commit`, `/review`, `/compact`) to meta-configuration (`/config`, `/permissions`, `/hooks`, `/mcp`).

The question that kept nagging me as I reverse-engineered this system: how do you keep 80+ commands discoverable without overwhelming the user? The answer involves a surprisingly sophisticated combination of fuzzy search, feature gating, availability filtering, visibility controls, and a skill system that blurs the line between commands and AI-invocable capabilities. Let me walk through all of it.

## Command Registry: The Central Nervous System

Everything starts in `src/commands.ts`. This file is the single registration point for every slash command in the system. The architecture has three layers:

**Layer 1: Static imports.** About 80 commands are imported directly at the top of the file. These are the "always available" commands -- things like `/help`, `/compact`, `/cost`, `/clear`, `/model`, `/theme`, etc.

**Layer 2: Feature-gated imports.** A block of conditional `require()` calls loads commands only when specific feature flags are active:

```typescript
// src/commands.ts:62-122
const proactive =
  feature('PROACTIVE') || feature('KAIROS')
    ? require('./commands/proactive.js').default
    : null
const voiceCommand = feature('VOICE_MODE')
  ? require('./commands/voice/index.js').default
  : null
const forceSnip = feature('HISTORY_SNIP')
  ? require('./commands/force-snip.js').default
  : null
const workflowsCmd = feature('WORKFLOW_SCRIPTS')
  ? (
      require('./commands/workflows/index.js') as typeof import('./commands/workflows/index.js')
    ).default
  : null
```

Note the use of `require()` instead of `import()` here. This is deliberate -- these are synchronous conditional loads that happen at module initialization time. The `feature()` function reads from a compile-time flag system (via `stubs/bun-bundle.js`), enabling dead code elimination in the production build. If `VOICE_MODE` is not enabled in the build, the entire voice command module gets tree-shaken away.

**Layer 3: Dynamic command sources.** The `loadAllCommands()` function merges in commands from five additional sources:

```typescript
// src/commands.ts:449-469
const loadAllCommands = memoize(async (cwd: string): Promise<Command[]> => {
  const [
    { skillDirCommands, pluginSkills, bundledSkills, builtinPluginSkills },
    pluginCommands,
    workflowCommands,
  ] = await Promise.all([
    getSkills(cwd),
    getPluginCommands(),
    getWorkflowCommands ? getWorkflowCommands(cwd) : Promise.resolve([]),
  ])

  return [
    ...bundledSkills,
    ...builtinPluginSkills,
    ...skillDirCommands,
    ...workflowCommands,
    ...pluginCommands,
    ...pluginSkills,
    ...COMMANDS(),
  ]
})
```

The ordering matters: bundled skills come first, then plugins, then skill directories, then built-in commands. This means a plugin or skill can shadow a built-in command name. The `getCommands()` function that callers actually use applies two more filters on top -- `meetsAvailabilityRequirement()` and `isCommandEnabled()` -- and also merges in dynamically discovered skills that were found during file operations.

The whole thing is memoized by `cwd` using lodash's `memoize`, since loading is expensive (disk I/O, dynamic imports). There is also a `clearCommandsCache()` function that nukes every layer of the memoization hierarchy when commands need to be reloaded.

## Command Interface: The Three Types

Every command in the system conforms to the `Command` type defined in `src/types/command.ts`. The base shape is:

```typescript
// src/types/command.ts:175-203
export type CommandBase = {
  availability?: CommandAvailability[]
  description: string
  hasUserSpecifiedDescription?: boolean
  isEnabled?: () => boolean
  isHidden?: boolean
  name: string
  aliases?: string[]
  isMcp?: boolean
  argumentHint?: string
  whenToUse?: string
  version?: string
  disableModelInvocation?: boolean
  userInvocable?: boolean
  loadedFrom?: 'commands_DEPRECATED' | 'skills' | 'plugin' | 'managed' | 'bundled' | 'mcp'
  kind?: 'workflow'
  immediate?: boolean
  isSensitive?: boolean
  userFacingName?: () => string
}
```

There are three command types, and the distinction is architecturally important:

**`local` commands** execute synchronously in the Node process and return a `LocalCommandResult` -- either text, a compaction result, or a skip signal. These are things like `/cost`, `/compact`, `/clear`. They use lazy loading via a `load()` function that returns a promise of a module with a `call()` function. This keeps the startup cost low -- the actual command implementation is not loaded until the user types the command.

**`local-jsx` commands** render React (Ink) components. They get a richer context including `setMessages`, `canUseTool`, and UI callbacks like `onChangeAPIKey` and `onInstallIDEExtension`. Commands like `/help`, `/skills`, `/config`, `/mcp`, `/resume` are local-jsx because they need to render interactive UI elements.

**`prompt` commands** are the most interesting. They do not execute locally at all -- they generate content blocks that get injected into the conversation as a prompt to the model. This is how skills work: `/review` does not review code itself, it constructs a detailed prompt asking Claude to review code. The `PromptCommand` type has additional fields like `progressMessage`, `contentLength` (for token estimation), `allowedTools`, `model` override, and `context` ('inline' vs 'fork' for sub-agent execution).

The `source` field on prompt commands tracks provenance: `'builtin'`, `'mcp'`, `'plugin'`, `'bundled'`, or a `SettingSource` like `'userSettings'`, `'projectSettings'`, `'policySettings'`. This is displayed in the typeahead UI so users know where a command came from.

## Fuzzy Search: Fuse.js Does the Heavy Lifting

With 80+ commands, exact-match lookup would be unusable. Claude Code uses Fuse.js for fuzzy matching, implemented in `src/utils/suggestions/commandSuggestions.ts`.

The Fuse index is built once per command array identity (the array is memoized in the REPL) and cached:

```typescript
// src/utils/suggestions/commandSuggestions.ts:53-80
const fuse = new Fuse(commandData, {
  includeScore: true,
  threshold: 0.3, // relatively strict matching
  location: 0, // prefer matches at the beginning of strings
  distance: 100, // increased to allow matching in descriptions
  keys: [
    {
      name: 'commandName',
      weight: 3, // Highest priority for command names
    },
    {
      name: 'partKey',
      weight: 2, // Next highest priority for command parts
    },
    {
      name: 'aliasKey',
      weight: 2, // Same high priority for aliases
    },
    {
      name: 'descriptionKey',
      weight: 0.5, // Lower priority for descriptions
    },
  ],
})
```

The weight distribution tells you about the design intent: command names are 6x more important than description words. The `partKey` field is clever -- it splits hyphenated command names like `install-github-app` into `['install', 'github', 'app']` so typing "github" matches even though it is in the middle of the name.

The sorting after fuzzy search applies a strict priority cascade: exact name match > exact alias match > prefix name match > prefix alias match > fuzzy score with usage frequency as tiebreaker. There is also logic to handle hidden commands -- if a user types the exact name of a hidden command, it gets prepended to the results even though Fuse's index excluded it.

When the user just types `/` with no query, the system shows a categorized list: recently used skills (top 5 by usage score), then built-in commands, then user settings commands, then project commands, then policy commands, then everything else. Each category is sorted alphabetically.

The system also supports mid-input slash commands -- typing text then ` /com` in the middle of a message triggers the suggestion system for that embedded command reference. The `findMidInputSlashCommand()` function handles this by looking backwards from the cursor position for a `/` preceded by whitespace.

## Feature-Gated Commands: Three Layers of Hiding

Claude Code uses three separate mechanisms to control command visibility, and understanding when each applies is critical:

**`isEnabled()`** is a function that returns a boolean. It is re-evaluated on every `getCommands()` call. Commands that fail this check are completely invisible -- not just hidden, but removed from the command list entirely. Examples: `/compact` checks `!isEnvTruthy(process.env.DISABLE_COMPACT)`, `/voice` checks `isVoiceGrowthBookEnabled()`, `/fast` checks `isFastModeEnabled()`.

**`isHidden`** is a property (often a getter) that controls typeahead visibility. Hidden commands still work if you type the exact name -- they just do not appear in suggestions. This is used for internal/debug commands like `/heapdump` (`isHidden: true`) and commands whose visibility is conditional, like `/cost` which hides itself for Claude.ai subscribers:

```typescript
// src/commands/cost/index.ts:12-17
get isHidden() {
  if (process.env.USER_TYPE === 'ant') {
    return false
  }
  return isClaudeAISubscriber()
},
```

**`availability`** is a static declaration of which auth/provider environments support the command. It uses a `CommandAvailability` type with values `'claude-ai'` and `'console'`. The `meetsAvailabilityRequirement()` function in `commands.ts` checks this before any command appears in the list. This is separate from `isEnabled()` because availability is about who you are (auth context), while enablement is about what is turned on (feature flags, env vars).

There is also a fourth layer specific to internal development: the `INTERNAL_ONLY_COMMANDS` array in `commands.ts` contains about 20 commands that only load when `process.env.USER_TYPE === 'ant'` and `!process.env.IS_DEMO`. These include `/commit`, `/commit-push-pr`, `/issue`, `/mock-limits`, `/share`, and various debugging tools.

## Skills as Commands: The Blurry Line

One of the most architecturally interesting decisions in Claude Code is that skills and slash commands share the same `Command` type. A skill is just a prompt-type command with some extra metadata. The system loads skills from multiple sources:

1. **Bundled skills** (`src/skills/bundledSkills.ts`) are compiled into the CLI. They are registered via `registerBundledSkill()` which wraps a `BundledSkillDefinition` into a full `Command` object with `loadedFrom: 'bundled'` and `source: 'bundled'`.

2. **Skill directory skills** are markdown files loaded from `~/.claude/skills/`, `.claude/skills/` (project-level), and managed settings paths. The `loadSkillsDir.ts` module reads these files, parses frontmatter for metadata (description, arguments, model override, allowed tools, hooks), and wraps them as prompt commands.

3. **Plugin skills** come from installed plugins and get `source: 'plugin'` with plugin manifest metadata attached.

4. **MCP skills** come from MCP servers and get `loadedFrom: 'mcp'`.

5. **Dynamic skills** are discovered during file operations when the model touches files matching a skill's `paths` glob patterns. These are tracked in state and merged in at `getCommands()` time.

The `getSkillToolCommands()` function filters the full command list to just the prompt-type commands that the model can invoke via the Skill tool. The filtering logic is nuanced -- it excludes `source: 'builtin'` commands (those are user-facing, not model-facing) and requires either a user-specified description or a `whenToUse` field for plugin/MCP commands. Bundled skills and skill directory skills always pass because they get auto-derived descriptions.

The `disableModelInvocation` flag lets you create skills that only the user can invoke (via typing `/skill-name`), while `userInvocable` controls the reverse -- whether users can invoke a skill that was designed for the model.

## Cost Tracking Architecture: Every Token Counted

The cost tracking system is split across three files: `src/cost-tracker.ts` for the high-level API, `src/utils/modelCost.ts` for per-model pricing calculations, and `src/bootstrap/state.ts` for the actual state storage.

The global state in `bootstrap/state.ts` tracks:
- `totalCostUSD` -- running USD total
- `totalAPIDuration` / `totalAPIDurationWithoutRetries` -- time spent waiting for API responses
- `totalToolDuration` -- time spent executing tools
- `totalLinesAdded` / `totalLinesRemoved` -- code change metrics
- `modelUsage` -- a `{ [modelName: string]: ModelUsage }` map with per-model token breakdowns
- OpenTelemetry counters for cost and tokens (attributed by model and speed tier)

The `ModelUsage` type tracks seven dimensions per model: input tokens, output tokens, cache read tokens, cache creation tokens, web search requests, cumulative USD cost, context window size, and max output tokens.

The core cost accumulation function is `addToTotalSessionCost()` in `cost-tracker.ts`:

```typescript
// src/cost-tracker.ts:278-323
export function addToTotalSessionCost(
  cost: number,
  usage: Usage,
  model: string,
): number {
  const modelUsage = addToTotalModelUsage(cost, usage, model)
  addToTotalCostState(cost, modelUsage, model)

  const attrs =
    isFastModeEnabled() && usage.speed === 'fast'
      ? { model, speed: 'fast' }
      : { model }

  getCostCounter()?.add(cost, attrs)
  getTokenCounter()?.add(usage.input_tokens, { ...attrs, type: 'input' })
  getTokenCounter()?.add(usage.output_tokens, { ...attrs, type: 'output' })
  // ...cache tokens...

  let totalCost = cost
  for (const advisorUsage of getAdvisorUsage(usage)) {
    const advisorCost = calculateUSDCost(advisorUsage.model, advisorUsage)
    totalCost += addToTotalSessionCost(advisorCost, advisorUsage, advisorUsage.model)
  }
  return totalCost
}
```

Notice the recursive call for "advisor" usage -- this handles cases where the primary model delegates to a secondary model (the advisor system), ensuring those costs are tracked separately but included in the total. Each advisor call gets its own analytics event with `tengu_advisor_tool_token_usage`.

The USD conversion in `src/utils/modelCost.ts` maintains a lookup table of per-model pricing tiers:

```typescript
// src/utils/modelCost.ts:36-42
export const COST_TIER_3_15 = {
  inputTokens: 3,
  outputTokens: 15,
  promptCacheWriteTokens: 3.75,
  promptCacheReadTokens: 0.3,
  webSearchRequests: 0.01,
} as const satisfies ModelCosts
```

These are prices per million tokens. The system defines tiers like `COST_TIER_3_15` (Sonnet-class: $3/$15), `COST_TIER_15_75` (Opus 4/4.1: $15/$75), `COST_TIER_5_25` (Opus 4.5/4.6: $5/$25), and `COST_TIER_30_150` (Opus 4.6 fast mode: $30/$150). When an unknown model is encountered, the system falls back to the default main loop model's pricing and sets a `hasUnknownModelCost` flag that adds a warning to the cost display.

The fast mode pricing for Opus 4.6 is particularly interesting -- the `getModelCosts()` function checks `usage.speed === 'fast'` on the API response to dynamically select between the $5/$25 and $30/$150 tiers for the same model.

## Cost Persistence: Surviving Session Boundaries

Cost state is ephemeral by default -- it lives in the in-memory `State` object in `bootstrap/state.ts`. But Claude Code needs costs to survive across session resumes. The persistence mechanism uses the project config file (`.claude/config.json`).

`saveCurrentSessionCosts()` serializes the entire cost state:

```typescript
// src/cost-tracker.ts:143-175
export function saveCurrentSessionCosts(fpsMetrics?: FpsMetrics): void {
  saveCurrentProjectConfig(current => ({
    ...current,
    lastCost: getTotalCostUSD(),
    lastAPIDuration: getTotalAPIDuration(),
    // ... all the metrics ...
    lastModelUsage: Object.fromEntries(
      Object.entries(getModelUsage()).map(([model, usage]) => [
        model,
        {
          inputTokens: usage.inputTokens,
          outputTokens: usage.outputTokens,
          // ... stripped of runtime-only fields ...
        },
      ]),
    ),
    lastSessionId: getSessionId(),
  }))
}
```

The restore path in `restoreCostStateForSession()` only restores if the session ID matches -- you do not accidentally inherit costs from a different session. When restoring, it re-derives `contextWindow` and `maxOutputTokens` from the current model configs rather than trusting stale values from disk.

The `useCostSummary()` React hook in `src/costHook.ts` wires this into the process lifecycle:

```typescript
// src/costHook.ts:6-22
export function useCostSummary(
  getFpsMetrics?: () => FpsMetrics | undefined,
): void {
  useEffect(() => {
    const f = () => {
      if (hasConsoleBillingAccess()) {
        process.stdout.write('\n' + formatTotalCost() + '\n')
      }
      saveCurrentSessionCosts(getFpsMetrics?.())
    }
    process.on('exit', f)
    return () => { process.off('exit', f) }
  }, [])
}
```

On process exit, it saves costs to disk and optionally prints the summary. The FPS metrics piggyback on this same save -- a clever reuse of the exit hook.

## Billing Integration: Who Sees What

The billing logic in `src/utils/billing.ts` determines who gets to see cost information. There are two separate functions for two different billing contexts:

`hasConsoleBillingAccess()` checks if you are a direct Anthropic Console API user (not Claude.ai, not third-party) with admin or billing roles at the org or workspace level. If `DISABLE_COST_WARNINGS` is set, it returns false. This gates the exit-time cost summary.

`hasClaudeAiBillingAccess()` checks if you are a Claude.ai subscriber with appropriate permissions. Consumer plans (Max/Pro) always have access. Team/Enterprise plans require admin, billing, owner, or primary_owner org roles.

The `/cost` command itself has another layer of logic. For Claude.ai subscribers, it shows subscription status rather than dollar amounts (since they are on a subscription, not pay-per-token). But there is an escape hatch for internal users:

```typescript
// src/commands/cost/cost.ts:18-19
if (process.env.USER_TYPE === 'ant') {
  value += `\n\n[ANT-ONLY] Showing cost anyway:\n ${formatTotalCost()}`
}
```

The formatted cost display aggregates usage by canonical model name (so `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` and any alias resolve to the same line), shows per-model breakdowns with input/output/cache-read/cache-write token counts, and includes web search request counts when non-zero.

## Slash Command Parsing: Simpler Than You Would Think

Given all the complexity above, the actual parsing of slash commands is refreshingly simple. `src/utils/slashCommandParsing.ts` is a 60-line file:

```typescript
// src/utils/slashCommandParsing.ts:25-59
export function parseSlashCommand(input: string): ParsedSlashCommand | null {
  const trimmedInput = input.trim()
  if (!trimmedInput.startsWith('/')) {
    return null
  }

  const withoutSlash = trimmedInput.slice(1)
  const words = withoutSlash.split(' ')

  if (!words[0]) {
    return null
  }

  let commandName = words[0]
  let isMcp = false
  let argsStartIndex = 1

  // Check for MCP commands (second word is '(MCP)')
  if (words.length > 1 && words[1] === '(MCP)') {
    commandName = commandName + ' (MCP)'
    isMcp = true
    argsStartIndex = 2
  }

  const args = words.slice(argsStartIndex).join(' ')
  return { commandName, args, isMcp }
}
```

Split on spaces, first word is the command, rest is args. MCP commands get special handling because they carry a `(MCP)` suffix marker. That is it. The sophistication lives in the lookup and fuzzy matching, not the parsing.

The `findCommand()` function in `commands.ts` does a simple linear scan checking name, user-facing name, and aliases:

```typescript
// src/commands.ts:688-698
export function findCommand(
  commandName: string,
  commands: Command[],
): Command | undefined {
  return commands.find(
    _ =>
      _.name === commandName ||
      getCommandName(_) === commandName ||
      _.aliases?.includes(commandName),
  )
}
```

No index, no hash map -- just `.find()`. With ~100 commands this is fine. The Fuse.js index handles the performance-sensitive typeahead path; the final lookup after selection is a one-time linear scan.

## Bridge and Remote Safety

One detail worth calling out: not all commands are safe to run in all contexts. Two sets -- `REMOTE_SAFE_COMMANDS` and `BRIDGE_SAFE_COMMANDS` -- whitelist commands for remote/mobile usage. The bridge safety predicate is type-aware:

```typescript
// src/commands.ts:672-676
export function isBridgeSafeCommand(cmd: Command): boolean {
  if (cmd.type === 'local-jsx') return false   // renders Ink UI
  if (cmd.type === 'prompt') return true        // expands to text
  return BRIDGE_SAFE_COMMANDS.has(cmd)          // explicit allowlist for 'local'
}
```

This exists because someone once tried to run `/model` from their phone, which tried to pop an interactive Ink picker on the server terminal. The fix was a principled type-based safety system: prompt commands are safe by construction (they produce text), JSX commands are always blocked (they render UI), and local commands need explicit opt-in.
